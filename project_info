What have i done to make this calculator?

#1. I have maitained a stack where i have put the elements one by one
#2. If two digits were entered consecutively , I tool them both and turned them both into a single element and the type was set to 'dig'
#3. If a decimal point was found i never allowed it to follow anything other than a 'dig' type , after getting the decimal . after a 'dig'
    i merged them both and turned them into a single element , i also changed the type from 'dig' to 'float'
#4. I allowed the use of opening bracket only after other opening brackets and operators.
#5. Closing brackets were allowed only after other closing brackets , dig and float types.
#6. + and -signs were not allowed only after other +/- signs
#7. *,/,%(multiplicative) signs were not allowed after other multiplicative signs and additive signs.
